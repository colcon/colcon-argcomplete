Description: Remove the data_files from the setup.cfg file since the
 Debian package can't rely on setuptools 40.5.0 or higher.
 Instead the custom logic in setup.py will handle these file for the
 Debian package.
 The custom logic doesn't work for a wheel though and therefore can't be
 used generically.
